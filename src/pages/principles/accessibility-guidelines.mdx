# Accessibility Guidelines

### Four Principles of Accessibility

##### Perceivable

Information and user interface components must
be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
(e.g. alt tags that say what the item actually
does, like ‘Submit form Button’).

##### Operable

User interface components and navigation must
be operable (e.g., you must be able to navigate
the site using a keyboard as well as a mouse).

##### Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface
must be understandable, (e.g. error messaging
on a form should make sense; instead of ‘Invalid
field’ messaging, use ‘The Email field must be
in a valid format’).

##### Robust

Content must be robust enough so it can be
interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user
agents, including assistive technologies. In
other words, don’t use tags or code that only
certain browsers understand.

### Guidelines Checklist

- ##### Text Alternatives

    Provide alternatives for non-text content
    (e.g., images) so that the content is
    accessible for all users.

- ##### Time-Based Media

    Provide an alternative (e.g. transcript)
    for time-based media (e.g., audio/video) that
    presents equivalent information, or link to
    textual information with comparable information
    for non-prerecorded media).

- ##### Adaptable

    Create content that can be presented in different
    ways without losing information or structure.

- ##### Distinguishable

    Make it easy for users to see and hear content,
    including separating foreground and background,
    by using readable fonts, larger font sizes, and
    highlighted link styling for example.

- ##### Keyboard Accessible

    Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

- ##### Timing

    Provide enough time for users to read and use content.

- ##### Seizures

    Do not include design elements that are known to
    cause seizures (e.g., rapid flashing).

- ##### Navigable

    Provide multiple ways to allow users to navigate
    content including obvious/prominent links and
    other techniques.

- ##### Readable

    Make text content readable and understandable
    via styling and other techniques.

- ##### Predictable

    Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

- ##### Input Assistance

    Assist users with web experience, correct mistakes
    and describe errors in text.

- ##### Compatible

    Maximize compatibility with current and future
    user agents, including assistive technologies.
