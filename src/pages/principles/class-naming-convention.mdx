  title: Class Naming Convention

# Class Naming Convention

The Spark Design System uses a strict class naming convention.
This allows us to keep our classes flat, avoid conflicts,
provide clarity, and improve legibility.  

This is done by combining 4 techniques:  

- a global namespace
- class prefixes
- pascal casing
- BEM syntax  

All classes in the Spark Design System must
adhere to this naming convention.

### Global Namespace

`.sprk-`

One of the most annoying things that happens when you
use a CSS library is class naming conflicts. You already
use the class `.button` and the library also uses it
and it overrides your styles.  

To avoid this, the Spark Design System uses a global
namespace to ensure that it's styles don't interfere
with the custom styles in your app.

### Class Prefixes

After the global namespace, each class name has a
prefix which gives information about what the
class is doing.

The prefixes available are:  

- `b-` (Base) For classes that add additional
style to base HTML elements.
- `o-` (Object) Cosmetic-free design patterns
that are very dangerous to change because they
are often used in unrelated contexts. E.g. the
OOCSS Media Object.
- `c-` (Component) Implementation-specific pieces
of UI. CSS is safe to change because it is isolated
to the specific component.
- `u-` (Utility) Highly specific, highly reusable,
usually single purpose, and have high specificity.
- `is-` `has-` (State) These classes are typically
added and removed through JavaScript or on the
server to show specific states.

### Pascal Casing

After the namespace and prefix, the main part
of the class name doesn't stand out very well.
For this reason we use pascal case to visually
separate it from the rest of the name. For example:  

`.sprk-c-HighlightBoard__content`

### Class Suffixes

Responsive suffix classes are used when you need
styles to be applied at specific breakpoints.
The `@` symbol must be escaped in the stylesheet.
For example:  

`.sprk-o-Flex@xl`

### BEM Syntax

BEM stands for "Block, Element, Modifier". It is a
modular application development methodology whose
naming convention has become very popular for writing
modular, flat CSS selectors.  

The 3 parts of BEM are:  

- **Block**

    The primary component block. In our convention
    it refers to the PascalCase part of the class.
    For example:

    `.sprk-c-HighlightBoard`

- **Element**

    A child of the primary block. It is represented
    by two underscores that separate it form the Block.
    For example:

    `.sprk-c-HighlightBoard__content`  

    The following is not allowed:

    `.sprk-c-HighlightBoard__content__child-content`

- **Modifier**

    A variation that extends either a Block or an Element.
    It is represented by two dashes that separate it from
    the Block or Element. For example:

    `.sprk-c-HighlightBoard--huge .sprk-c-HighlightBoard__content--image`

    The following is not allowed:

    `.sprk-c-HighlightBoard--huge--red`
