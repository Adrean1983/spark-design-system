# Design Principles

Our design principles capture the essence 
of what good design is, what it means to 
our company, and provide direction on how 
to achieve it.

## Clarity

Eliminate ambiguity. Enable people to see, 
understand and act with confidence.

## Consistency

Create familiarity and strengthen intuition 
by utilizing consistent design patterns in 
our experiences.

## Inclusivity

Craft an experience that recognizes the 
varying abilities of all people. Designing 
for those with disabilities will result in 
a better experience for everyone.

## Beauty

Every design decision should be purposeful. 
Build trust and further build confidence with 
an experience that looks beautiful and flows 
seamlessly.

## Delight

Enhance expressions through thoughtful and 
unexpected details that bring joy to every 
interaction.
