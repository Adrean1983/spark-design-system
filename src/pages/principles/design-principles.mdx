# Design Principles

Our design principles capture the essence
of what good design means to our company
and provide direction on how to achieve it.

## Clarity

Eliminate ambiguity. Enable people to see,
understand and act with confidence.

## Consistency

Create familiarity and strengthen intuition
by applying the same solution to the same
problem every time.

## Beauty

Every design decision should be purposeful.
Build trust and further build confidence with
an experience that looks beautiful and flows
seamlessly.

## Inclusivity

Craft an experience that recognizes the
varying abilities of all people. Designing
for those with disabilities will result in
a better experience for everyone.

## Delight

Enhance expressions through thoughtful and
unexpected details that bring joy to every
touchpoint.
