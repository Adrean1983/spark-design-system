# Installing Spark

The Spark Design System is designed for use in Angular, React, or plain HTML/JavaScript applications. Spark is distributed as [a Node repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spark-design-system).

In addition to the installation guides found in this section, we have starter repositories with Spark already set up in each of these frameworks.

* [`spark-starter-html`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html)
* [`spark-starter-angular`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular)
* [`spark-starter-react`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react)

Each of these repositories includes branches featuring Spark in various states of implementation.

| Branch | Description |
|---|---|
| `master` | The Spark Design System and all of its prerequisites are installed. Start building with Spark components right away. |
| `kitchen-sink` | The Spark Design System and all of its prerequisites are installed. In addition, a test page has been added that includes all the Spark components. This is useful for testing the latest version of Spark. |
| `without-spark` | This is a boilerplate app without Spark installed. This is useful for following along in our [Getting Started Guides](). |
