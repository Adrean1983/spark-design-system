# Installing Spark

<div className="sprk-b-TypeBodyTwo sprk-u-Measure">
In addition to the installation guides found in this
 section, we have starter repositories with Spark already
 set up in each of these frameworks.

* [`spark-starter-html`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html)
* [`spark-starter-angular`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular)
* [`spark-starter-react`](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react)

Each of these repositories includes branches featuring
Spark in various states of implementation.
</div>

| Branch | Description |
|---|---|
| `master` | The Spark Design System and all of its prerequisites are installed. Start building with Spark components right away. |
| `kitchen-sink` | The Spark Design System and all of its prerequisites are installed. In addition, a test page has been added that includes all the Spark components. This is useful for testing the latest version of Spark. |
| `without-spark` | This is a boilerplate app without Spark installed. This is useful for following along in our [Getting Started Guides](./installing-spark/html-installation). |
