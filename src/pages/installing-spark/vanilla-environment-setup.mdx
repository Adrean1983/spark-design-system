# HTML Environment Setup Guide 🌎

Welcome to the Spark Environment Setup guide. This guide will help you
set up a development environment with everything you need so you can
install and use Spark.

This guide is Part 1 in a 3-Part series.

- **Environment Setup** (You are here. 📌)
- [Spark Installation](../vanilla-installation.mdx)
- [Adding a Component](../vanilla-add-components.mdx)

We also have guides for installing and using Spark in [Angular]() and
 [React]() development environments.

What we'll cover in this guide:

* Creating the initial folder structure 🗂
* Installing Webpack 🛠
* Installing Sass 🎨

## Before We Begin

This guide makes extensive use of a tool called “Node Package
Manager” (`npm`). You can find installation instructions for `npm`
 [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Create the Folder Structure 🗂

The first step in creating your website is creating the initial
folder structure. These instructions assume that you are in a
Unix-based environment with a command line application.

Begin by making a new directory for your project, opening that
directory, and initializing `npm`.

```
mkdir spark-html

cd spark-html

npm init
```

This command tells `npm` to create a `package.json` file for your new site.
 `package.json` keeps track of all the dependencies that your site needs
 to build and run. You can accept all the default values for the `npm init` 
 command by hitting enter or fill in your own values. You can always
  edit these later in your `package.json`.

Now we are going to create the initial files for your new site. Inside
your `spark-html` folder, create a `src` folder and a `dist` folder.

In the `src` folder, create a file called `index.js` and copy this code into
it.

```
function component() {
  const element = document.createElement('div');
  element.innerHTML = 'Hello, Spark!';
  return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

In the `dist` folder, create a file called `index.html` and copy this code
into it.

```
<html>
  <head>
      <title>Hello, Spark!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Your folder structure should look like this:

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={folderStructure}
  alt="Placeholder alt text for this image."/>

If you open `index.html` in a web browser, you should see this:

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={helloSpark}
  alt="Placeholder alt text for this image."/>

## 🛠 Install Webpack

Now we are going to set up a tool called [Webpack](). Once we have
 Spark installed, we will use Webpack to combine all the JavaScript
 needed to run Spark (as well as any other JavaScript dependencies
  our website has) into one JavaScript file that we can include in
  our site.

Run this command to install Webpack.

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

> The `--save-dev` flag indicates that these packages are required
 to compile your website, but are not necessary to run the site
 after compilation.

In your `package.json` file, look for the `scripts` section. This section
is a list of custom commands that Node can run against your package.
 You're going to add a new one for building the site with Webpack.

```
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack"
},
```

Now when we run this build script, Webpack will combine all our
JavaScript dependencies into a single JavaScript file called 
`main.js`. We want our site to use that file, so change the line
in `index.html` where we set up the `<script>` tag to look like this:

```
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

Now you can build your website by running this command:

```
npm run build
```

You should now see a `main.js` file in your dist directory
containing minified JavaScript.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={bundledJs}
  alt="Placeholder alt text for this image."/>

## 🎨 Install Sass

All the CSS for Spark is included in Spark’s `npm` package. In order
 to use these styles in your site, you're going to import them using
  a tool called [Sass]().

Sass is a tool that processes and compiles CSS. In our example,
we’re going to use Sass to compile an `scss` file into a `css` file
that you can then reference in your site. In the next guide, we’ll
 use Sass to import all the Spark CSS and include it in your site.

For more info on Sass, check out the [Sass Getting Started Guide]().

First, run this command to install all the packages you'll use to
 build the site CSS.

```
npm install node-sass sass-loader css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev
```

In the root directory of your project, create a new file called 
`webpack.config.js` and paste this code into it.

```
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          'css-loader',
          'sass-loader',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'bundle.css'
    }),
  ],
};
```

This config file tells Webpack to do two things.

1. For any `scss` or `sass` files in the project, compile them first
using a tool called `sass-loader`, then with `css-loader`, and finally
with a tool called `MiniCssExtractPlugin`.

2. When `MiniCssExtractPlugin` finishes processing the CSS, put the
 output into a file called `bundle.css`.

At the top of `index.js`, add this reference to the uncompiled `scss`
 file.

```
import "../src/style.scss"
```

Now when Webpack compiles `index.js`, this import line will include
 your style file, which will be processed according to the rules
 we set up in the webpack config in the previous step.

Now let’s write some CSS to compile.

Create a new file in `src` called `style.scss` and copy this CSS into it:

```
body {
  background-color: green;
}
```

In `index.html`, add this reference to your new compiled CSS.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bundle.css"></link>
```

Now when you rebuild your site, you should see `bundle.css` in the
`dist` folder and your website should now include your style:

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={greenBg}
  alt="Placeholder alt text for this image."/>

## 🎉 You did it!

You now have a development environment set up and ready to install
 Spark. For guidance on how to install Spark, check out the [HTML
 Installation Guide](). We also have Environment guides for [Angular]()
 and [React]() environments.
