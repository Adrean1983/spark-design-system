# Adding Components

Now you’re ready to start writing the HTML to build the structure of the components you’ll be using. Here we’ll cover how to add components for HTML, CSS and JavaScript environments with no JavaScript framework. You can follow along with the code examples in this
guide using the sample app found in our <a href="https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/" target="_blank">starter repository</a>.

This guide is Part 3 in a 3-Part series. You can also check out
[Part 1 - Setting Up Your Environment](./html-environment-setup) and
[Part 2 - Installation](./html-installation)

For instructions on setting up Spark in other environments, check out the
guides for [Angular](./angular) and [React](./react) development environments.

## Navigating to Component HTML

1. To get started, select the <a href="../using-spark" target="_blank">Using Spark</a> tab at the top of this page. This is where you’ll find all the HTML you’ll need for the component variants and configurations you can use.

2. Underneath the *Components* section in the left column, find the component you want to add.

> **For example**: Let’s say you’re trying to add a Submission Spinner Button. You’d select the <a href="../using-spark/components/button" target="_blank">Button</a> component.

3. Click the *HTML* link to view the HTML documentation.

4. Navigate to the *Docs* tab at the top of the screen.

5. Scroll down until you see the component variant you would like to include in your site.

6. Click *Show code*.

7. Copy the sample code into `index.html`.

> **For example**: If you’re adding a Submission Spinner Button, you’d scroll down on the Button page to find <a href="https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--spinner" target="_blank">Submission Spinner</a>. Then you’d copy the Submission Spinner Button code that looks like this:

```
<button class="sprk-c-Button" data-sprk-spinner="click">

Submit

</button>
```

> **Note**: make sure you’re including `main.js` after the HTML elements in `index.html`. The `<script>` line should be at the bottom of the `<body>` tag.

8. You should see the component you just installed with all the correct Spark CSS applied.

> **For example**: If you’ve added a Submission Spinner Button you’ll see something like this…

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm "
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={spinnergif}
    alt="A Spark Button Spinner component."/>
</div>
