# Getting Started with Spark Icons

The Spark Design System supports two methods
for including SVG icons. Icons can either be
built into your site at **compile time** or
dynamically loaded at **run time**. Each
method has advantages and disadvantages,
detailed below.

For more information on working with SVG icons, check out
[this guide](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/).

## At Compile Time

This method involves downloading the latest
SVG from the correct CDN URL as part of your
build/development process, and then embedding
that SVG directly into your compiled site.
This way, all the SVGs are already included
in your site when the page loads and an additional
request is not necessary. All the load time for
downloading the SVG from the CDN takes place
during development, not while the user is using
the page.

The big advantage of this method is performance
and reliability. Since the SVG has already been
downloaded as part of the build process, the user
does not need to wait for the CDN to serve the SVG.
That makes this method ideal for production
environments where load times are critical.

This method also gives development teams more
control over which SVGs are included in the site.
Since the SVG file is downloaded during development,
developers can review the SVG file before publishing,
and can include only the SVG versions they’ve tested.

The downside of this method is more development work
up front setting up the build and maintaining the
connection to the CDN over the long term.

>***Note***: If you use this method you must not put
the SVG file in your source control repository.
The SVG file should only be hosted on the official CDN.

### Examples

- Using [Gulp](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L11)
- Using [Gatsby](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-design-system/blob/staging/plugins/gatsby-symbol-set-fetch/gatsby-node.js)

## At Run Time

Using this method, the full SVG including the entire icon
set is injected into your site as a separate HTTP request
while the page is loading. This is typically done with an
AJAX request that executes on page load. The full SVG
containing all the icons is embedded at the top of the
page so that they are available to be used in the body
of the page.

The big downside of this method is performance. You can
easily end up downloading the icons more than once on
subsequent page loads (making the user wait for multiple
downloads), and even if you’re only downloading them once,
the user still needs to wait for that download to complete
separate from the main site download, during which time
the page has loaded but the icons are not visible.

The big advantage of this method is that it requires the
least amount of setup and additional tooling. This makes
it ideal for quick, non-production projects.

Another potential side-effect of this method is that if
the SVG file on the CDN changes, you’ll get the update
immediately without a chance for review.

### Examples

- Using an [AJAX call on page load](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-design-system/blob/staging/storybook-utilities/icon-utilities/icon-loader.js)
- Using an [Angular component](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular/blob/kitchen-sink/src/app/spark-docs/icon-set/icon-set.component.ts)
- Using a [React component](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react/blob/kitchen-sink/src/components/IconSet/IconSet.js)

## Tips
- The Icon SVG must be included in the page before the
first icon is used, typically at the top of the page,
directly after the `<body>` element.
- To use your own icon set with the Spark components,
you must make sure your icons have the exact same names
as the icons listed [here](/using-spark/components/icon).
- For internal users, you can access a directory of
our CDN resources [here](http://shorty/sparkassetcdn).
