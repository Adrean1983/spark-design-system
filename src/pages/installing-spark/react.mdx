# React Installation Guide âœ¨

This is a guide for installing Spark and using Spark
 React components on an existing React site. You can
 find a guide for setting up the necessary development
 environment in the `create-react-app` Getting Started Guide.

 What we'll cover in this guide:



ðŸŽ¨ Installing Sass



ðŸ§± Installing Spark Packages



ðŸ§­ Navigating to Component Code Samples



ðŸ“˜ Including React Components in your site

At the end of this guide you will have all the Spark React components available in your site and ready for development.

## ðŸŽ¨ Installing Sass

In order to use the Spark styles in your site, you're going to import them using a tool called Sass.



Sass is a tool that processes and compiles CSS. In this step, youâ€™re going to use Sass to import a CSS file that you can then reference in your site. In the next step, weâ€™ll use Sass to import all the Spark CSS.



Run this command to install Sass in the project:

```
npm install node-sass --save-dev
```

Rename App.css to App.scss.

In App.js, update the import line to point at the new filename.

```
import â€˜./App.scssâ€™
```

Create a new file in src called styles.scss and copy this CSS into it:

```
body {

  border: 50px solid pink;

}
```

In App.scss, add an import for this new file

```
@import â€˜./styles.scssâ€™;
```

If your React server has stopped, restart it now and view your compiled React site. You should see the new CSS youâ€™ve written included in the site along with the original React CSS.

## ðŸ§± Installing Spark Packages

All the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS needed to run Spark React components is available in our npm packages. You can download the required packages with this command:

```
npm install @sparkdesignsystem/spark @sparkdesignsystem/spark-react --save-dev
```

Now that you have the files installed, you need to import the Spark Sass file into the main Sass file for the project (e.g., App.scss).

```
@import '../node_modules/@sparkdesignsystem/spark/spark.scss';
```

Now when you build and run your website, all the Spark CSS will be bundled into your output. The easiest way to verify that this is working is to add a Spark component, which we will do in the next step. You can also verify that the Spark CSS is being included by inspecting your siteâ€™s DOM and looking for the Spark CSS. There should be a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of your page that includes all the Spark styles.

## ðŸ§­ Navigating to Component Code Samples

On sparkdesignsystem.com, weâ€™ve documented all the Spark components with copy/paste examples for many variants and configurations you can use in your site.

Letâ€™s include a Spark Button component from the site.

TODO: Instructions on accessing the Gatsby/Storybook site and getting to the React copy/paste code. Fill this section in once the site navigation is working.

## ðŸ“˜ Including React Components in Your Site

Add a reference to the SprkButton component at the top of App.js.

```
import { SprkButton } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark-react';
```

Copy the sample code for the Spark Button Spinner component into the return block in App.js.

```
function App() {

  return (

    <SprkButton loading>Submit</SprkButton>

  );

}
```

You should see a Spark Button with the correct Spark style applied.

## ðŸŽ‰ You did it!

Youâ€™re ready to start building with Spark! For additional help configuring and using Spark, check out some of our other guides:

The Polyfills Guide will help you import JavaScript polyfills needed for Spark. Polyfills are needed for Spark to function across all modern browsers.

For help importing the Spark SVG Icon Set, check out our Icon Installation Guide.

Guidance on accessing and including the Rocket Sans font used by Spark can be found in our Font Installation Guide.

Looking for help on theming Spark or modifying any of the default styles? Sounds like youâ€™d be interested in our Spark Overrides Guide.

Working with the DatePicker component? This component requires its own configuration object which is described in the Datepicker Configuration Guide.
