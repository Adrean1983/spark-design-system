# Angular Installation 📐

This is a guide for installing Spark and using Spark Angular components on an existing Angular application. You can find a guide for setting up the necessary development environment in the Angular CLI Guide. When setting up your application, make sure to include Angular Routing and SCSS when prompted.

What we'll cover in this guide:

🧱 Installing the Spark Package

🧭 Discovering component code samples

📘 Including Spark Angular Components in your application

At the end of this guide you will have all the Spark JavaScript and CSS available in your application and be ready to build with Spark components.

As of this writing, Angular 6, 7, and 8 are supported. Spark does not officially support Angular JS.

## Before We Begin

This guide assumes

you have a functioning Angular app similar to the one created in the Angular CLI Guide

Sass is installed and functioning (this is part of the Angular CLI Guide)

Angular Routing is installed (not required by this guide, but it is required by Spark)

You can download a repo with these prerequisites here.

## 🧱 Installing Spark Packages

To begin, navigate to your project directory and install spark and spark-angular by pasting the following line in a command line application.

```
npm install -save-dev @sparkdesignsystem/spark @sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular
```

Edit app.module.ts to import the spark-angular library as well as the BrowserAnimationsModule, and include them in @NgModule's imports array. This file can be found in your-app/src/app.

```
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';



import { SparkAngularModule } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark-angular';

import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';



@NgModule({

   declarations: [

      AppComponent

   ],

   imports: [

      SparkAngularModule,

      BrowserAnimationsModule,

      BrowserModule,

      AppRoutingModule

   ],

   providers: [],

   bootstrap: [AppComponent]

})

export class AppModule { }
```


Next, edit styles.scss to @import the spark stylesheet. This file can be found in you-app/src.

```
@import "node_modules/@sparkdesignsystem/spark/spark.scss"
```

> Note: Importing Spark SCSS at the component level can lead to unexpected behavior.

Great! Back on the command line, let’s build and run your new application by running npm run start and opening http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser. When Angular builds, Spark’s styles will be processed and bundled into the application. The best way to verify that this is working is to add a Spark component, which we will do in the next step. You can also verify that Spark’s styles are being included by opening your browser’s developer tools and inspecting the DOM. There should be a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` that includes Spark’s styles.

## 🧭 Navigating to Component Code Samples

Now that everything is building, let’s include a Spark Button component in your application.

On sparkdesignsystem.com, we’ve documented all the Spark components with copy/paste examples for many variants and configurations you can use in your application.

TODO: Instructions on accessing the Gatsby/Storybook site and getting to the Angular copy/paste code. Fill this section in once the site navigation is more finalized.

## 📘 Including Spark Angular Components in Your Application

Let's add a component to your application that will allow us to test that both Spark’s styles and functionality are working. The Spinner variant of the Button component is perfect for this.

First, copy the Spinner Button example code inside app.component.html. This file can be found in your-app/src/app. You can delete everything in this file other than the final line (<router-outlet></router-outlet>)

```
<button

   (click)="checkSpinner($event)"

   sprkButton

>

   Button

</button>
```

You should now see a Spark Button in your application! It’s ok if it looks slightly cropped, that’s just because we don’t have any layout on the page.

Now let’s add some TypeScript to trigger the Spinner behavior. Copy this code into the AppComponent class inside app.component.ts. This file can be found in your-app/src/app.

```
export class AppComponent {

   submitSpinning = false;



   checkSpinner(event): void {

      if (!this.submitSpinning) {

         setSpinning(event.target, {});

         this.submitSpinning = true;

      }

   }

}
```

Finally, import the setSpinning utility function from the Spark library. This goes at the top of your component’s .ts file, in our case app.component.ts.

```
import { setSpinning } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark';
```

Head back to your web browser and click the Spark Button that you added earlier. If everything is working correctly, the text should be replaced with an animated spinner.

## 🎉 You did it!

You now have a development environment with Spark installed and are ready to start adding more Spark components. If you need additional help configuring Spark for your environment, check out some of our other guides and email the Spark team with any questions.

The Polyfills Guide will help you import JavaScript polyfills needed for Spark. Polyfills are needed for Spark to function across all modern browsers.

Guidance on accessing and including the Rocket Sans font used by Spark can be found in our Font Installation Guide.
