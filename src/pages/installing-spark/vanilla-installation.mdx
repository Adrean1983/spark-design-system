# HTML Spark Installation Guide ✨

This is a guide for installing Spark into an existing site. This guide covers Spark installation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no JavaScript framework.



This guide is Part 2 in a 3-Part series.



1. Environment Setup

📌 2. Spark Installation

3. Adding a Component



We also have guides for installing and using Spark in Angular and React development environments.



What we'll cover in this guide:

🧱 Install Spark Package



⚙️ Configure Spark



At the end of this guide you will have all the Spark JavaScript and CSS available in your site and ready for development with Spark components.

## Before We Begin

This guide builds on the previous guide in the series. You can download the finished project from the previous guide here.

## 🧱 Install Spark Package

First, use npm to install the Spark package.

```
npm install --save-dev @sparkdesignsystem/spark
```

This will download all the JavaScript and CSS needed to render the Spark components.



Currently these assets are in the node_modules folder. In order to access them in your compiled website, you need to tell Webpack to import them in your JavaScript.



If you are continuing with the project that was built in the previous guide, replace the entire contents of index.js with this:

```
// tell Webpack to import the Spark JavaScript

import spark from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/es5/spark";

import sparkPrerender from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/es5/sparkPrerender";



// tell Webpack to import the Spark CSS

import "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/_spark.scss";



// initialize Spark

sparkPrerender();

spark();
```

Now when you build your website, the Spark assets will be included in the output. You can verify that this is the case by checking the compiled bundle.css and main.js in your solution. You should see the compiled Spark CSS and JavaScript.

```
npm run build
```

## ⚙️ Configure Spark

The last thing you need to do is configure your website to work with Spark.

In index.html, find the body element and add the data-sprk-main attribute.

```
<body data-sprk-main>
  ...
</body>
```

> This attribute is required for some Spark components to correctly handle focus changes.

## 🎉 You did it!

You now have a development environment with Spark installed and are ready to start adding Spark components. For guidance on adding HTML Spark components, check out the  Adding a Component  guide.



If you need additional help configuring Spark for your environment, check out some of our other guides:



The Polyfills Guide will help you import JavaScript polyfills needed for Spark. Polyfills are needed for Spark to function across all modern browsers.

For help importing the Spark SVG Icon Set, check out our Icon Installation Guide.

Guidance on accessing and including the Rocket Sans font used by Spark can be found in our Font Installation Guide.

Looking for help on theming Spark or modifying any of the default styles? Sounds like you’d be interested in our Spark Overrides Guide.

Working with the DatePicker component? This component requires its own configuration object which is described in the Datepicker Configuration Guide.

## 🙀 Troubleshooting



Uncaught ReferenceError: SPRK_CURRENT_VERSION is not defined 



Make sure you're importing Spark from the correct directory:


```
import spark from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/es5/spark";
```


not this:


```
import spark from "@sparkdesignsystem/spark/spark";
```

 WARN Hit error self signed certificate in certificate chain



This is often caused by corporate firewall configurations and can sometimes be fixed by prefixing npm install with NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0.



NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 npm install --save-dev @sparkdesignsystem/spark

Spark js is being called but none of my components are being initialized.



Make sure you are calling spark() after the DOM is loaded. You may need to move the `<script>` tag in index.html to the bottom of the file.



---



The Webpack build is completing without errors but spark js and css are not being applied to my site.



Make sure you are referencing your JavaScript and CSS files correctly in index.html. In our example, we needed to change the import from src/index.js to main.js.
