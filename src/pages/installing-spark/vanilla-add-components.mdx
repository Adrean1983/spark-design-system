# HTML Components ðŸ§©

This is a guide for adding a Spark component to an environment in which Spark has already been installed. This guide covers Spark components for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript environments with no JavaScript framework.

This guide is Part 3 in a 3-Part series.

- [Environment Setup](./vanilla-environment-setup)
- [Spark Installation](./vanilla-installation)
- **Adding a Component** (You are here. ðŸ“Œ)


We also have guides for installing and using Spark in Angular and React development environments.



What we'll cover in this guide:



ðŸ§­ Navigating to Component HTML



ðŸ“˜ Including Component HTML in your site



Youâ€™ve already set up an environment with all the JavaScript and CSS needed for Spark components. Now youâ€™re ready to start writing the HTML to build the structure of the components youâ€™ll be using.

## Before We Begin

This guide builds on the previous guide in the series. You can download the finished project from the previous guide here.

## ðŸ§­ Navigating to Component HTML

On sparkdesignsystem.com, weâ€™ve documented all the HTML youâ€™ll need with copy/paste examples for many variants and configurations you can use in your site.

Letâ€™s include a Spark Button component from the site.

TODO: Instructions on accessing the Gatsby/Storybook site and getting to the HTML copy/paste code. Fill this section in once the site navigation is working.

## ðŸ“˜ Including Component HTML in Your Site

Copy the sample code for the Submission Spinner component into index.html.

```
<button class="sprk-c-Button" data-sprk-spinner="click">

Submit

</button>
```

> Note: make sure youâ€™re including main.js after the HTML elements in index.html. The `<script>` line should be at the bottom of the `<body>` tag.

You should see a Spark Button with all the correct Spark CSS applied. When you click the button, it should correctly apply the Spark JavaScript and animate.
