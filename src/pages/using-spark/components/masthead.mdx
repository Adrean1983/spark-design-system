# Masthead

The Masthead is the first component on
a page and includes navigation elements.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="masthead--default-masthead"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  minHeight="25rem"
  maxWidth="100%"
/>

## Usage
This version of the Masthead is commonly
used when the user is signed out,
the site has no user accounts or there
is a small amount of navigational links.
The big navigation (wide gray navigation bar)
is not included in this version.

## Guidelines
- The Masthead is "sticky" and content will flow under it.
- On narrow viewports when a user scrolls down the page, the masthead will become hidden.
When the user scrolls back up towards the top of the page, the masthead will come back into view.

## Accessibility
This is a11y stuf.

### Extended Masthead

Shows information that is
important for a client to read.
Information Alerts have a Bell icon.
