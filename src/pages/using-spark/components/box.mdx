# Box

Box is a layout component that
separates a group of content
from its surroundings.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="box--default-box"
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Use Box when you have a group of content that
needs to be visually separated from other
content on the page through padding.

Since the effects of Box are only seen through
whitespace, the example has a background
color to illustrate how Box works.

### Guidelines

- By default, Box padding is set to Medium.
- Box has 6 built in padding sizes that are paired with our Spacing values.
  - Flush (`0px`)
  - Tiny (`4px`, `$sprk-space-inset-xs`)
  - Small (`8px`, `$sprk-space-inset-s`)
  - Medium (`16px`, `$sprk-space-inset-m`)
  - Large (`32px`, `$sprk-space-inset-l`)
  - Huge (`64px`, `$sprk-space-inset-xl`)

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- Box is an empty container using Inset Space.
