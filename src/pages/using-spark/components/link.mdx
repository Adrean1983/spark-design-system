# Link

A Link takes the user to another page
or to a specific location on a page. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Use a Link when you want the user to
navigate to another page, a specific
location on a page, or to download a document. 

### Guidelines

- Link text should clearly describe where
the Link will take the user. It must answer,
“what will the user get when they interact
with this?” 
- Avoid ambiguous Link text like “Click Here”.
- Don’t use a Link if you aren’t navigating
somewhere or downloading a document unless 
the proper accessibility considerations are met.
- Links should primarily be part of a sentence
or near other text content. 

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Base Link

Base Link is the standard Link style and
should be used for most hyperlinks. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--default-link"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Simple Link

Simple Link is a more subtle styles which
looks more like regular body copy. It is
perfect inside menus, footers, and other
elements where context implies an ability
to interact with the text. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--simple"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Icon with Text Link

This style combines an Icon with text.
This is most useful in menus or standalone
text and shouldn’t be used in a sentence.  

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--icon-with-text-link"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Disabled

Disabled Link represents a link that is not
currently available for interaction. Using
this variation helps screen readers and other
assistive technologies understand that the
Link can’t be interacted with.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--disabled"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Anatomy

- A Link must contain text.
- A Link may contain an icon. 

## Accessibility

- Avoid using Link to perform actions other than
navigation or accessing external resources, like
a file download. If you do, you must provide the
appropriate [accessibility controls](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).
