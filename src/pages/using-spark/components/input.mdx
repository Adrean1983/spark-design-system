# Input

Input allows a user to enter and submit data.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Usage for Input depends on the Input type.
Please see the Usage and Guidelines for each
Input type. Take care to choose the appropriate
Input type for your use case.

### Guidelines

- Labels and error messages should be short,
instructional, and to the point.
- Labels should be kept to one line.
- If an Input needs more information than can
be provided in the label, use Helper Text.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## States

Each input has an error and disabled state.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--invalid-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--disabled-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Variants

### Text Input

A Text Input allows users to enter and edit
text. It is the most common Input type.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Huge Text Input

Huge Text Input is a larger version of Text
Input. The label is inside the Input instead
of above it. On focus, the label animates to
the top left of the Input and placeholder
text takes its place.  

Huge Text Input was designed for a multi-step
form flow that presents a single Input per page.
For this reason, Huge Text Input should only be
used for stand-alone Inputs. An exception would
be a set of fields that are typically together,
like an address.

#### Guidelines

- Labels must be short enough to fit inside the
Input and cannot wrap to a second line.
- The following Inputs are currently able to use
the Huge Text Input style:
  - SSN Input
  - Password Input
  - Phone Number Input
  - Date Input
  - Date Picker

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-huge-text--huge-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Checkbox

Checkbox allows a user to choose more
than one option from a list.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-checkbox--checkbox"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Radio Button

Radio Button allows a user to
choose one option from a list.

#### Guidelines

- If the list of choices becomes too large,
consider using a Select Box instead. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-radio--radio-button"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Select Box

Allows a user to select one choice from a set of options.

#### Guidelines

- If there are only a few options in the set,
consider using Radio Button. 
- Select Box is not the same as the Dropdown
component.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-select--select-box"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Huge Select Box

This is a larger version of the Select Box,
consistent with the style of Huge Text Input.
The label is shown inside the select. On focus,
the label animates to the top left.  

Like Huge Text Input, Huge Select was designed
for a multi-step form flow that presents a single
Input per page. For this reason, Huge Select Box
should only be used for stand-alone Inputs.

#### Guidelines

- Labels must be short enough to fit inside the
Input and cannot wrap to a second line.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-huge-select--huge-select-box"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Textarea

Textarea allows a user to enter multiple
lines of freeform text.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-textarea--textarea"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### SSN Input

SSN Input is used to collect a Social
Security Number.
- Checking "Show SSN" removes the mask
and shows the entered value.
- If “Show SSN” is checked, this field is
automatically formatted to ###-##-####
once a valid value is entered.
- SSN Input can also be a Huge Text Input.
For full functionality, see guidelines in
the Huge Text Inputs section.
- Additional engineering is required to
reformat user input into an SSN pattern
(###-##-####)
  - After valid input, it should reformat
  to having the first three numbers, a dash,
  the next two numbers, a dash, and the last
  four numbers.
- Additional engineering is required for
validation functionality.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-ssn--ssn-input"

### Search Input

Search Input allows a user to make a search query.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-search--search-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Monetary Input

Monetary Input is used to collect a value in US dollars.
- This field is automatically formatted to include commas,
a decimal, and 2 zeros (If no decimal is entered) when focus
is removed from the field (e.g. 1,000.00).
- Additional engineering is required to reformat user
input into a monetary pattern (##.##)
  - After valid input, it should reformat to add commas
  and decimals to the hundredth place.
- Additional engineering is required for validation functionality.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-monetary--monetary-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Percentage Input

Percentage Input is used to collect a percent value.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-percentage--percentage-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Password Input

Password Input is used for collecting a password.
- The value is masked by default.
- Checking "Show Password" removes the mask and
shows the entered value.  
- Password Input can also be a Huge Text Input.
For full functionality, see guidelines in the
Text Huge Inputs section.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-password--password-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Helper Text

Helper Text provides additional guidance that helps
the user understand what information the input requires.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-helper-text--helper-text"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Phone Input

Phone Input is used to collect a phone number.
- Additional engineering is required to reformat user
input into a phone number pattern (###) ###-####.
  - After valid input, it should reformat to have
  the area code surrounded by parenthesis, a space
  before the next three digits, and a dash before
  the next four digits.
- Additional engineering is required for validation functionality.
- Phone Input can also be a Huge Text Input. For full
functionality, see guidelines in the Text Huge Inputs section.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-phone--phone-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Date Input

Date Input is used for collecting a well-known date
(e.g. birthdate) or a date in the far future or
past (i.e. when did you move?). It does not include
a date picker.
- Additional engineering is required to reformat
user input into a date pattern (MM/DD/YYYY).
- After valid input, it should reformat to a two
digit number month, followed by a forward slash,
two digit number day, followed by another forward
slash, and four digit number year.
- Additional engineering is required for validation
functionality.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-date--date-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Date Picker

Date Picker is used for collecting a date around one
year before or after the current date. We restrict
the distance from the current date because it is more
difficult for a user to find the date they need when
they must page through dozens of months.
- Additional engineering is required to reformat user
input into a date pattern (MM/DD/YYYY). 
- After valid input, it should reformat to a two digit
number month, followed by a forward slash, two digit
number day, followed by another forward slash, and
four digit number year. 
- Additional engineering is required for
validation functionality.
