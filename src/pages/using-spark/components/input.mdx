# Input

Input allows a user to enter and submit data.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Usage for Input depends on the Input type.
Please see the Usage and Guidelines for each
Input type. Take care to choose the appropriate
Input type for your use case.

### Guidelines

- Labels and error messages should be short,
instructional, and to the point.
- Labels should be kept to one line.
- If an Input needs more information than can
be provided in the label, use Helper Text.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## States

Each input has an error and disabled state.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--invalid-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--disabled-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Variants

### Text Input

A Text Input allows users to enter and edit
text. It is the most common Input type.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Huge Text Input

Huge Text Input is a larger version of Text
Input. The label is inside the Input instead
of above it. On focus, the label animates to
the top left of the Input and placeholder
text takes its place.  

Huge Text Input was designed for a multi-step
form flow that presents a single Input per page.
For this reason, Huge Text Input should only be
used for stand-alone Inputs. An exception would
be a set of fields that are typically together,
like an address.

#### Guidelines

- Labels must be short enough to fit inside the
Input and cannot wrap to a second line.
- The following Inputs are currently able to use
the Huge Text Input style:
  - SSN Input
  - Password Input
  - Phone Number Input
  - Date Input
  - Date Picker

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-huge-text--huge-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Checkbox

Checkbox allows a user to choose more
than one option from a list.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-checkbox--checkbox"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Radio Button

Radio Button allows a user to
choose one option from a list.

#### Guidelines

- If the list of choices becomes too large,
consider using a Select Box instead. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-radio--radio-button"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Select Box

Allows a user to select one choice from a set of options.

#### Guidelines

- If there are only a few options in the set,
consider using Radio Button. 
- Select Box is not the same as the Dropdown
component.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-select--select-box"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Huge Select Box

This is a larger version of the Select Box,
consistent with the style of Huge Text Input.
The label is shown inside the select. On focus,
the label animates to the top left.  

Like Huge Text Input, Huge Select was designed
for a multi-step form flow that presents a single
Input per page. For this reason, Huge Select Box
should only be used for stand-alone Inputs.

#### Guidelines

- Labels must be short enough to fit inside the
Input and cannot wrap to a second line.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-huge-select--huge-select-box"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Textarea

Textarea allows a user to enter multiple
lines of freeform text.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-textarea--textarea"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>
