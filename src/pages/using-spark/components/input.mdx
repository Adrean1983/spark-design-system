# Input

Input allows a user to enter and submit data.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Usage for Input depends on the Input type.
Please see the Usage and Guidelines for each
Input type. Take care to choose the appropriate
Input type for your use case.

### Guidelines

- Labels and error messages should be short,
instructional, and to the point.
- Labels should be kept to one line.
- If an Input needs more information than can
be provided in the label, use Helper Text.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## States

Each input has an error and disabled state.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--invalid-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--disabled-text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Variants

### Text Input

A Text Input allows users to enter and edit
text. It is the most common Input type.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="input-text--text-input"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Huge Text Input

Huge Text Input is a larger version of Text
Input. The label is inside the Input instead
of above it. On focus, the label animates to
the top left of the Input and placeholder
text takes its place.  

Huge Text Input was designed for a multi-step
form flow that presents a single Input per page.
For this reason, Huge Text Input should only be
used for stand-alone Inputs. An exception would
be a set of fields that are typically together,
like an address.

#### Guidelines

- Labels must be short enough to fit inside the
Input and cannot wrap to a second line.
- The following Inputs are currently able to use
the Huge Text Input style:
  - SSN Input
  - Password Input
  - Phone Number Input
  - Date Input
  - Date Picker
