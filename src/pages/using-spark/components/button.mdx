# Button

A Button represents an action or choice for the user.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Buttons are the main actionable items on a page.
Buttons typically trigger a new UI element to appear
on the page and are essential to submitting forms,
beginning a new task, or navigating to the next
step in a process.

### Guidelines

- Effective Button text uses precise, task-specific
action verbs like: “Add”, “Remove”, “Read Details”,
and “Submit”. Avoid ambiguous words like “Yes”,
“No”, “OK”, and “Click Here”.
- Effective Button text is less than 20 characters.
- All button text should be in title case
(capitalize the first letter of each word).
- Button text should never wrap to a second line.
- Button width should not exceed 280px.
- For navigational actions that appear within
a line of text, use [Link](/using-spark/components/link)
instead of Button.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Primary Button

The most important action on the page should
use Primary Button. Effective action flows
contain one Primary Button per page.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Secondary Button

A Secondary Button typically represents the
highest priority alternative to the Primary Button.
There can be more than one on a page and can depict
similar or different actions.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--secondary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Tertiary Button

A Tertiary Button represents the lowest prioritized
action on a page. They are typically used in a
[Modal](/using-spark/components/modal)
to cancel a choice. They look like a text
[Link](/using-spark/components/link)
but have the same padding and focus rules as other Buttons.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--tertiary"

/>

## States

### Disabled

A Disabled Button represents an action that is not
currently available for the user. They imply that
the Button would be available, given a certain set
of circumstances. Since a user cannot interact with
this button, consider if it’s necessary to show the
disabled button at all. Otherwise, make it clear
in the interface why a button is Disabled.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Loading

When data is being saved or submitted, a loading
indicator may replace the Button text.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--loading"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Secondary Button Loading

When data is being saved or submitted, a loading
indicator may replace the Button text.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--loading-secondary"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
/>


### Full Width at Smaller Viewports

At small viewport sizes, a Button may be used at full width.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--full-width-at-small-viewport"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Anatomy

- A Button must contain text and/or an Icon

## Accessibility

- If a Button only includes an Icon with no
text, alternative text must be provided.
