# Alert

An Alert is a way to notify users
without interrupting their actions.
Alerts are to appear at the top of the
page. They consist of an icon
(in either a success, info, or error state),
an area for text, and an optional dismiss button.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--success"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Usage
An Accordion should be used when
content needs to be broken down,
but is still important enough to
be of primary interest on the page.
This Accordion's design is used to
give it some visual weight
within the design and make it
apparent that the content is important.

## Guidelines
- May have timed visibility (10 seconds)
  and/or be dismissed by the user by clicking the "x" icon.
- If the content wraps to a new line the
  icon on the left should remain vertically
  centered, but the dismiss icon should
  remain in place at the top right.
- Should fill the width of the viewport.
- The content should be kept short and concise.

### Information Alert

important for a client to read.
Information Alerts have a Bell icon.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--info"

  hasHTML
/>

### Success Alert

These provide positive feedback to
a user's action. Success Alerts
have a checkmark icon.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--success"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Fail Alert

These provide negative feedback to a
user's action. Fail Alerts have an exclamation mark icon.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--fail"
  hasReact

### Alert With No Dismiss Button

Alerts can be used without the dismiss
button. Here is a Success Alert
that is not able to be dismissed.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--no-dismiss-button"

  hasHTML
