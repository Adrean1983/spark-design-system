# Tooltips

The tooltips component appears as a popup design providing a short text description of information about a feature when the user hovers over the item.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="tooltip--default-story"
  minHeight="10rem"
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Use tooltips when the feature needs to be explained in further detail to walk users through a specific action. It helps to draw the users' attention to a feature without interrupting their workflow.

- Appears when a user hovers or focuses on the tooltip icon.
- Remains visible if the user hovers off of the icon onto the tooltip.
- Can be toggled open by clicking or tapping on the tooltip icon, or with the Enter or Space keys.
- Remains in view until the component is no longer hovered or focused.
- Can be dismissed with the Escape key on the keyboard.

### Guidelines

- Content within tooltips must be text-based with a maximum character count of 140.
- Do not use as a warning or alert.
- Do not include in links or modals.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- The tooltip will automatically orient itself according to the available screen space.

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={tooltipExample}
  alt="The Spark Tooltip component depicted in four different orientations."/>

## Accessibility
Tooltips are discoverable and [operable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#operable) by users that rely on a diverse set of established navigational means. Also, in compliance with [1.4.13: Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html) WCAG rules, we make sure that any content appearing on hover or focus is dismissible and persistent.

- Accessible by mouse, pointer devices, keyboard-only, screen reader, zoom software, and any other assistive technology.
- Tooltips use `aria-describedby` and `id` to establish a relationship between the trigger and content for screen readers and other assistive technology.
- Tooltips use `aria-hidden` so they are unreachable by screen readers when the tooltip is not expanded.
- Add text alternatives to icon buttons to express action user is taking.
