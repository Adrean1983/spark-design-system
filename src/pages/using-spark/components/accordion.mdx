# Accordion

An Accordion is a simple way of showing,
hiding and breaking down content. It
should be used when a large group
of related content needs to be
separated into smaller, digestible
chunks. An Accordion consists of a
series of Toggle components.

## Usage
An Accordion should be used when
content needs to be broken down,
but is still important enough to
be of primary interest on the page.
This Accordion's design is used to
give it some visual weight
within the design and make it
apparent that the content is important.

## Guidelines
- Content length inside the Accordion does not have a limit.
- Title content of the Accordion can wrap, but it is recommended
  that it is short and to the point.
- Accordions take up 100% width of their parent container until
  they hit their max width of 850px.
- The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools.
  If you have multiple instances of the same variant of a
  component on the same page, make sure each instance
  has a unique data-id property
  ("accordion-primary-1", "accordion-primary-2", "accordion-secondary-1", etc).
