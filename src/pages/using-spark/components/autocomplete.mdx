# Autocomplete

Autocomplete input fields allow the browser to predict information being
entered by the user. The browser should display options based on
previous information entered.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-story"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="15rem"
/>

### Usage

Autocomplete helps users search for options that are difficult to remember or
commonly misspelled. They allow designers to include more options to choose
from, with less space.

### Guidelines

Autocomplete input fields should be used:

- When information can be predicted from previously entered information.
- When accuracy and speed are important to the user.
- When the number of options is no longer convenient or efficient to display
  in a select box.
- When a select box has too many options but can be predicted for the user
  (i.e. states, countries).

Best practices for Autocomplete input fields:

- Try to keep lists under 10 matching options so the user doesn't have to
  scroll.
- Guide the user by highlighting the most relevant suggestion.
- Use text wrapping for longer suggestions.
- Order suggestions by relevancy for quick selection.
- Ensure the Autocomplete list is not blocking other elements on mobile.

Autocomplete is commonly used for search bars where accurate, quick suggestions
help the user choose the correct data format for a task.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-story"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="15rem"
/>

## States

Each Autocomplete variant has an error and disabled state.

### Error

<ComponentPreview componentName="autocomplete--default-invalid" hasHTML />

### Disabled

<ComponentPreview componentName="autocomplete--default-disabled" hasHTML />

## Variants

### Huge

Huge Autocomplete is a larger version of the Autocomplete field.

They're commonly used as a standalone feature on the page.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--huge"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Default

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Active Typing

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--active-typing"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Selecting Option

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--selecting-option"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### No Results Found

Provide guidance and offer suggestions if no results are found or do not match any information in the database.

Create a better experience for the user by:

- Expressing empathy.
- Clearly communicate the state of the result.
- Offer suggestions for next steps.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--no-results-found"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"></SprkDivider>

## Additional Customizations

### No Search Icon

Showing a search icon is not required if an autocomplete is part of a larger form.

Use the search icon when an autocomplete is independent of other form elements on the page to provide clarity that this is a search field.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--no-search-icon"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Address - two lines of text

Addresses can span two lines when displaying the full address.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--two-lines-of-text"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### No label above field

A label is not required for this input type. Autocomplete inputs should not use a label when used in a masthead.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--no-label-above-field"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Search across categories

If there are different types of results for the same search term that users may need to look, then the categories can be featured at the top of the list for users to choose.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--search-across-categories"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

### Focused - without search (option)

Use a focused state when users have recently interacted with the autocomplete input. By including terms they have searched in the past, we can help navigate to results quicker.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--focused"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- May have a search icon.
- Must show predictive suggestions in a dropdown.
- Must have suggestions that can be selected.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interactions:

- Use the `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` keys to:

  - Cycle through auto-suggestions and input field.
  - Move visual focus to the last suggested value.

- Use the `Enter` key to:

  - Set the text box value to the content of the selected option.
  - Closes the list box/menu.

- Use the `Escape` key to:

  - Close the list.
  - Clear the text box.
  - If the list box is displayed, closes it or closes the menu.

- Use the `Tab` key to:
  - Select the currently focused auto suggestion.
  - Close the menu and move focus to the next focused element.

### Screen-reader Interaction

- When the search-field gains focus, an initial instruction is announced.
- When search results are returned, the count and instructions are announced.
- When suggestions are arrowed through, theyâ€™re spoken aloud.
- When suggestions are arrowed through, focus remains on the search-field while visual focus shifts to the active list element.

### Guidelines

- When utilizing autocomplete for form data (ex. autocomplete for states and countries), element should be set to Inline.

- In all other cases, the default setting should be [List](https://sparkdesignsystem.com/using-spark/components/list).
