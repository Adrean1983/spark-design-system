# Autocomplete

Autocomplete input fields allow the browser to predict information being
entered by the user. The browser should display options based on
previous information entered.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-story"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="15rem"
/>

### Usage

Autocomplete helps users search for options that are difficult to remember or
commonly misspelled. They allow designers to include more options to choose
from with less space.

### Guidelines

Autocomplete input fields should be used:

- When information can be predicted from previously entered information.
- When accuracy and speed are important to the user.
- When the number of options is no longer convenient or efficient to display
in a select box.
- When a select box has too many options but can be predicted for the user
(i.e. states, countries).

Best practices for Autocomplete input fields:

- Try to keep lists under 10 matching options so the user doesn't have to
scroll.
- Guide the user by highlighting the most relevant suggestion.
- Use text wrapping for longer suggestions.
- Order suggestions by relevancy for quick selection.
- Ensure the Autocomplete list is not blocking other elements on mobile.

Autocomplete is commonly used for search bars where accurate, quick suggestions
help the user choose the correct data format for a task.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-story"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="15rem"
/>

## States

Each Autocomplete variant has an error and disabled state.

### Error
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-invalid"
  hasHTML
/>

### Disabled
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--default-disabled"
  hasHTML
/>

## Variants

### Huge

Huge Autocomplete is a larger version of the Autocomplete field.

They're commonly used as a standalone feature on the page.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="autocomplete--huge"
  hasHTML
  minHeight="27rem"
/>

The Autocomplete pattern is based on the principle of recognition over recall.
