# Alert

Alert is an unobtrusive, yet highly visible,
way to display important information and
provide feedback to user action. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--success"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Alert is used when you need to give
information to the user or feedback
after an action. For example, to show
that a form submission was successful
or to let the user know that their attention
is needed on another section of the site.
Alert may have timed visibility (10 seconds)
and/or be dismissed by the user by clicking
or tapping the Close Icon. 

### Guidelines

- Alert must appear above the main content
of the page, but below the Masthead.
- The message text of Alert should be
clear and concise. 
- Alert should not be used at the top of
sidebars or other narrow layout elements. 

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Information Alert

An Information Alert has a Bell Icon
and indicates that a message is important
for the user to read. These alerts are
typically already on the page when the user arrives. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="alert--info"

  hasHTML
/>

and provides positive feedback to a user’s action.

/>

### Fail Alert

and provides negative feedback to a user’s action.
