# CSS Utilities

The Spark Design System includes many CSS utility classes for customizing and
 extending components. These utility classes are divided into two groups:
 [Single-Property Utilities](#single-prop) and [Multi-Property Utilities](#multi-prop).

## Single-Property Utilities<a name="single-prop"></a>

Single property utilities map directly to a single CSS property and value.
They are most useful when you want to override a default value or in
one-off situations. Be aware that all Single-Property Utilities include
an `!important` flag in order to supersede an element's default styles.

### Display and Visibility

These utilities control CSS properties related to display and visibility.

<section>
  <CssUtilityTable group="display"/>
</section>

### Floats, Position, and Alignment

These utilities control CSS properties related to floating, positioning, and alignment.

<section>
  <CssUtilityTable group="position"/>
</section>

### Typography

These utilities control CSS properties related to typography.

<section>
  <CssUtilityTable group="typography"/>
</section>

### Overflow

These utilities control CSS properties related to overflow, which specifies
 how to handle content that is too large for its container.

<section>
  <CssUtilityTable group="overflow"/>
</section>

### Width

These utilities set the width of an element to a percentage value.
The widths are in increments of 5 from 5% to 100%.

<section>
  <CssUtilityTable group="width"/>

### Spacing

These utilities override the padding and margin on an element. The class name
 format is `.sprk-u-<type><location><size>`

#### Options

* **type**: `p` or `m` (padding or margin)
* **location**: which side(s) of the element to apply the class to.
  * `a` (all)
  * `t` (top)
  * `r` (right)
  * `b` (bottom)
  * `l` (left)
  * `h` (horizontal)
  * `v` (vertical)
* **size**: The size of the spacing added.
  * `s` - small (8px)
  * `m` - medium (16px)
  * `l` - large (32px)
  * `h` - huge (64px)
  * `n` - none (0px)

#### Examples

<section>
  <CssUtilityTable group="spacing"/>

### Miscellaneous Spacing

These utilities override the padding and margin on an element and are
supplemental spacing sizes. The class name format is `.sprk-u-<Type><Location>--<size>`

#### Options

* type: `Padding` or `Margin`
* location: `All`, `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom`, `Left`, `Horizontal`, or `Vertical`
* size:
  * `a` = `$sprk-space-misc-a` (24px)
  * `b` = `$sprk-space-misc-b` (40px)
  * `c` = `$sprk-space-misc-c` (48px)

## Multi-Property Utilities<a name="multi-prop"></a>

 common actions. They are not meant to override default styles, but aid in
  things like accessibility and layout.
