Our Design Tokens are a catalog from which we base all our visual and branding choices.

They centralize our core styles like colors, typography, spacing, sizing, and much more.

Spark Design Tokens currently generate style files for web, iOS, and Android platforms.

## Benefits

## How to Use Our Design Tokens

 For Designers
</h3>

Use token names to communicate the specific style values of your design.

Token names depict style choices that portray color, spacing, typography, and more.

For example, the token `sprk-black-tint-20` represents a specific shade of gray. Style consensus makes it clear to everyone which gray you mean.

For HTML, React, and Angular projects, follow our [install guides](/installing-spark). They show you how to import the correct scss file.

** How to Change Spark's Default Style Settings: **
1. Create a new Sass file.
2. Import it before Spark's main Sass file.
3. Assign a new value to the variable you want to override.

> These make global changes to your project. Changing a variable affects all instances of its relevant components. For one-off modifications, use [CSS utilities](/using-spark/foundations/css-utilities).
