The Rocket Orbit color palette received an update in August 2020. Please review this guide carefully so that you can apply the colors correctly. Our objective is to achieve human-centered design in everything we do.

Having a consistent color palette is one of the foundations of a unified user experience.

We take accessibility seriously and comply with WCAG 2.1 contrast guidelines, and we do our best to account for the needs of all people.

## Our Color Story
From one of our designers:

"It reminded me of when Felix Baumgartner jumped from the edge of space. I watched the live stream while at work in Australia. It took him 2 hours and 21 minutes in a helium capsule to get there. But the thing I remember the most when watching it, as he ascended and the curvature of the earth became more pronounced, it created this beautiful tapestry of color as he moved through the atmospheres and how the light would reflect and as your perspective changed.

So as not to lean too heavily in a literal sense on our name, it provided me with a source of inspiration as to how we can approach one of the most fundamental elements of light, which is color."

The Orbit palette is designed to be modern and approachable and fit our brand character and highlight color psychology attributes.

## How to Use These Colors
Color is an important part of our brand. When color is applied correctly it tells a story and helps users navigate a page.

 Color is meant to be applied minimally and intentionally to draw focus. The page should feel minimalistic and color should be conveying brand meaning, interaction, and data and graphs.

 We recommend taking a look at the page and asking:

 - What am I communicating?
 - Do the red and purple feel like they are used appropriately?
 - Is there too much color in one area that my eye is drawn there? Should users be focused in this area?

Color should not be used as the only way to communicate information (Do not only show a red error or a green success message without using a label).

### Floods of Color
Floods of colors indicate areas of focus in the interface but content should mainly be on white backgrounds.
<img
  srcset={stepperExampleSet}
  src={stepperExample}
  sizes="(min-width: 1120px) 1120px,
        (min-width: 1680px) 1680px,
        560px"
  class="sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure"
  alt="The brand colors on a dark background."/>

Floods of color should be reserved for the below colors only:

#### Dark



#### Light
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="flood-light" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl"/> -->

### Semantic Colors
Semantic colors are used to depict noteworty information, such as success or urgency. They should not be used outside of their intended context.
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="semantic" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl"/> -->

### Button and Link Hierarchy



#### Charts and Graphs
Charts and graphs use shades of purple to represent different parts of the graphs.

Pink can be used to call out something negative, or a semantic color can be used to call out a positive or negative action.
Do not mix multiple semantic colors within one chart. They are only an accent to the purple gradient palette.

<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="charts-graphs" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl"/> -->

#### Credit Score
To show credit score we show it go from Pink to Purple. Pink is a negative color while purple is a positive color. Permutations of credit score get these colors applied like this:
<img
  srcset={creditScoreSet}
  src={creditScore}
  sizes="(min-width: 1120px) 1120px,
        (min-width: 1680px) 1680px,
        560px"
  class="sprk-u-mbl"
  style="max-width:300px"
  alt="The brand colors relating to levels of credit score."/>

<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="positive-negative" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbh"/> -->

## Color Palette
### Primary
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="primary" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl"/> -->

### Secondary
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="secondary" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl"/> -->

### Semantic
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="semantic" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl" /> -->

### Neutral
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="neutral" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl"/> -->

### Colors from Positive to Negative
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="positive-negative" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbl"/> -->

### Charts and Graphs
<!-- <ColorSwatchGrid color="charts-graphs" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbh"/> -->
