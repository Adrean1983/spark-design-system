order: 4
description: The full width variation allows the background image of the highlight board to span the entire width of
  the viewport.
information:
 - If an image is used in this variation, the image must have a wider aspect ratio. This will cause a zoom effect on narrow
   viewports, so you should use a responsive images solution to replace it.
