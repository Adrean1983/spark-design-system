description:
  The different button types available in Spark are Primary, Secondary,
  Tertiary, Submission, Diasabled, and Remove. A button should always
  trigger an action or something that changes the current state. For example,
  submitting a form or entering into edit mode. Buttons use the large variation of the
  Inset Short spacing setting which makes them have 16px of vertical padding and 32px of horizontal padding.

restrictions:
  - Do not use icons within buttons
  - Do not use <input type="submit"> for submit buttons, use <button> instead
  - If your button is not a submit button then use the type="button" attribute
  - Do not exceed 280px in width for a single button
  - Button content should not wrap to two lines
  - A button HTML element should be used when doing an action that doesn't have a meaningful URL
  - An anchor HTML element should be used when you want the look of a button but are linking to a URL
  - If your button is disabled or becomes disabled then add the disabled attribute
