notes: |
  Spark buttons are found in the Spark-Core package. The different types available in Spark are Primary, Secondary,
  Tertiary, Submission, Diasabled, and Remove buttons. The Primary button is built by using the .sprk-c-Button class. To get any of the other
  buttons add their class to the Primary button class. A button should always
  trigger an action or trigger something that changes the state of the site. For example,
  submitting a form or entering edit mode.

info:
  - A button HTML element should be used when doing some action that doesn't have a meaningful URL
  - An anchor HTML element should be used when you want the look of a button but are linking to a URL
  - Button height and width will be dependent on the size of the content inside the button
  - The content will always be centered both vertically and horizontally inside the button
  - Buttons use the $space-inset-short-l value for padding which makes the button have 16px of vertical padding and 32px of horizontal padding
  - If your button is not a submit button then use the type="button" attribute
  - If your button is disabled or becomes disabled then add the disabled attribute

nonos:
  - No orange buttons
  - No icons within buttons
  - Do not use <input type="submit"> but use <button> instead
  - Do not exceed 280px in width for a single button
  - Button content should be short enough so that it does not wrap
