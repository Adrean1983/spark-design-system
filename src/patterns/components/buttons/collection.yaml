  Examples of buttons.

info:
  - <button> should be used when doing some action that doesn't have a meaningful URL.
  - <a> should be used when you want the look of a button but are linking to a meaningful URL.
  - Button height and width will be dependent on the size of the content, but the content should always be centered both vertically and horizontally.
  - Buttons should have 40px of horizontal padding on each side of the content.
  - Extend the buttons to the full width of the container when on mobile and stack when there is more than one (TODO - Determine breakpoints)

nonos:
  - No orange buttons
  - No icons on buttons
  - Do not use <input type="submit">
