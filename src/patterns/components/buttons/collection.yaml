notes: |
  Button types available in Spark are Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Submission, Diasabled,
  and Remove. The Primary button is built by using the .sprk-c-Button class. To get any of the other
  modified button versions you would add that versions modified CSS class in addition to
  the .sprk-c-Button class. A button should always trigger an action or trigger something
  that changes the state of the site. For example, submitting a form or entering edit mode.

info:
  - A button element should be used when doing some action that doesn't have a meaningful URL
  - An anchor element should be used when you want the look of a button but are linking to a URL
  - Button height and width will be dependent on the size of the content inside the button
  - The content will always be centered both vertically and horizontally inside the button
  - Buttons use the $space-inset-short-l value for padding which makes the button padding 16px on the top/bottom and 32px on the sides
  - Use the type="button" attribute if your <button> is not a submit button otherwise omit it as the default type is submit
  - Use the disabled attribute on <buttons> that are disabled

nonos:
  - No orange buttons
  - No icons within buttons
  - Do not use <input type="submit"> but use <button> instead
  - Do not exceed 280px width for a button
  - Button content should be short enough so that it does not wrap
