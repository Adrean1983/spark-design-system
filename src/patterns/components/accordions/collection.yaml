  An Accordion is a simple way of showing, hiding and breaking down content.
  It helps to make content easier to find because it allows the content to be broken up.
information:
  - Content length inside the accordion does not have a limit.
  - Title content of the accordion can wrap, but it is recommended that it is short and to the point.
  - Accordions take up 100% width of their parent container until they hit their max width of 850px.
