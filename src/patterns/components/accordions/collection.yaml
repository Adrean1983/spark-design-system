description: An Accordion is a simple way of showing, hiding and breaking down content. It should be used when a
  large group of related content needs to be separated into smaller, digestible chunks. An accordion consists of
  a series of <a class="drizzle-b-Link" href="/patterns/components/toggle.html">Toggle</a> components.
information:
  - Content length inside the accordion does not have a limit.
  - Title content of the accordion can wrap, but it is recommended that it is short and to the point.
  - Accordions take up 100% width of their parent container until they hit their max width of 850px.
