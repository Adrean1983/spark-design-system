  Dividers are used for visually breaking up sections of a page.
restrictions:
  - The &lt;hr&gt; element has the same style as dividers, but should only be used
    when there is a thematic break between paragraph-level elements, for
    example, a change of scene in a story or a shift of topic within a section.
    If you are simply creating a visual separation, use a divider.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have
    multiple instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make
    sure each instance has a unique data-id property ("divider-1", "divider-2",
    etc).
