Using <hr/> to break up sections:  
<hr /> stands for Horizontal Rule. 
This is used primarily when you want to separate a page into sections. 
It represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements.

In HTML4, the <hr /> tag was used to display as a horizontal rule or line. 
In HTML5, the <hr /> tag defines a thematic break. 
It WILL still display a horizontal line in visual browsers, but is now defined in semantic terms. 
The attributes previously available to <hr> in HTML4 has been deprecated. You can style <hr /> elements in CSS instead. 

Think of it as a way to distinguish topics within HTML. Itâ€™s a way to visually distinguish between
2 different topics, sections, paragraphs, etc. 



Example Usage:

<p> The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. </p>
<hr />
<p> The second rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. </p>
<hr />
<p> The third rule of Fight Club is: No touching of the hair or face. </p>
