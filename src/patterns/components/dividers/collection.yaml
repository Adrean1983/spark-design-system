Using <hr/> to break up sections:  
<hr /> stands for Horizontal Rule. 
This is used primarily when you want to separate a page into sections. 
It represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements.

If a user needs a line that's not necessarily a semantic <hr /> but more of as a divider/separator, then use:

<span class="sprk-c-Divider">
</span>

But if it's an actual semantic use of <hr />, then use an <hr /> tag.

Because not all horizontal lines are semantically hrs –– sometimes they're just dividers

Think of it as a way to distinguish topics within HTML. It’s a way to visually distinguish between
2 different topics, sections, paragraphs, etc. 



Example Usage:

<p> The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. </p>
<hr />
<p> The second rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. </p>
<hr />
<p> The third rule of Fight Club is: No touching of the hair or face. </p>
