  Toggles have a clickable
  link and icon pair that show or hide a block of content.
  Use a Toggle when you need a simple way of showing, hiding and breaking down lengthy content.
  When the page loads the Toggle icon and link are shown but the content is hidden. When
  the icon or link are clicked the content will then be revealed.
information:
  - Icon will always appear on the left side of the Toggle content followed by the Toggle title.
  - The icon and the title of the Toggle will both open and close the content when clicked or tapped.
  - Toggles will look and function the same in all viewports.
  - Spark-Core has included Toggle JS that will setup the showing and hiding of the toggle content.
  - Spark-Core's Toggle JS will take care of initially adding and adjusting the aria-expanded HTML attribute based on
    if the content is hidden or visible.
  - You can adjust the spacing between the trigger link and the content by changing the spacing utility class on the content to a different size.
sparkPackageCore: true
restrictions:
  - Content that requires user interaction or consumption should
    not be housed within a Toggle.
  - A single Toggle should be used at a time and not several in succession.
  - Overall sizing of the Toggle should be dependent on type size, but should remain large enough to be tappable on a mobile device
  - Content length inside the Toggle does not have a limit, but shouldn't exceed a reasonable
    length.
  - The title of the Toggle doesn't have a specific maximum length and can wrap if needed.
