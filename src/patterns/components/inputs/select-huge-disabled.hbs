name: Select Box Huge - Disabled State
description:
  This select input is larger than the default select input and it's design is consistent with the huge text input.
information:
  - If a select will have a value on page load then add the class of 'sprk-b-Input--has-floating-label' to the select.
    Spark JS will check for a value in the select and float the label by adding the class on page load if the class is not there.
  - If a blank default option (a not required select) is desired then remove the 'disabled' and 'hidden' attributes
    from the first option in the select. This will allow users to select a blank first option.
restrictions:
  - The first option element inside the select must be empty and have the 'selected' attribute.
  - This should only be used in a form that displays one input at a time.
  - The select element must come before the label element.
  - Labels cannot be long in length as they must fit inside the select. They should not wrap onto a second line.
