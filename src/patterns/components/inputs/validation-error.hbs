name: Validation Criteria, Partially Met w/ Error
notes: |
  This is an example of inline validation on a field with validation criteria where all criteria are not met and the field has been blurred to reveal error state.
info:
  - This is only used for fields that have uncommon criteria or restrictions. For example, password and username.
  - The criteria should start hidden and appear below the form field when the field is focused.
  - Once anything is entered into the field, the criteria should remain visible.
  - On first focus, the criteria are gray and will become green as they are met.
  - If the field has been focused then unfocused and criteria are not met, the unmet criteria will turn red and the input will follow the error pattern.
  - Refocusing into the field and meeting criteria will clear all red colors, fulfilled criteria will turn green, and x's will become check marks.
nono:
  - The x-mark is not to be used for regular error messages.
