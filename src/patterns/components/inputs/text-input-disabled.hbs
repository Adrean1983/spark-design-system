name: Text Input - Disabled State
notes:
  This is a basic text input that is disabled.
info:
  - You need to make sure that the label's for attribute matches the id attribute of the input element.
    The input element's id should be unique on the page.
  - You need to make sure that the input element's type attribute is using the correct value that semantically
    matches your field's data.
  - You should use helper text, as seen below, when a user needs further clarification beyond the label.
order: 3
invisible: true
