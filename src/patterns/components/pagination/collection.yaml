  The Pagination component is comprised of a previous link, a next page link, and page number links.
  Use a Pagination component when you need a way to separate a large portion of content into smaller portions.
  It serves as navigation and informs users where they currently are and where they
  can go in the future.
information:
  - As a general guideline, you should use the "default" variant when the pager has three or fewer pages,
    and you should use the "long" variant when the pager has more than three pages. Note - the React and
    Angular implementations of this component will automatically change between these variants as needed.
restrictions:
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("pagination-1", "pagination-2", "pagination-3", etc).
