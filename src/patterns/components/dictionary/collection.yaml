notes: |
  This spark-extras pattern is intended for displays of key-value pairs.
restrictions:
   - This pattern expects a list of key-value pairs
   - Each key should have one, and only one, value.
   - Nesting Dictionaries is not supported
   - Tooltips or additional text is not supported
   - The length of keys and values is not limited, but will wrap to the next line if there's no room.
