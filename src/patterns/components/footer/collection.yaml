description:
  The Footer component is a collection of elements, which are determined to be secondary
  to the content of the page. The Footer component is typically used on every
  page of an application. The elements in the Footer are grouped by type or relevance.
  If your app requires the Footer
  to have a background color then you can check our our background color utilities page and
  add one background color CSS class to a container HTML element that wraps the Footer markup.
  Optionally, there are font color utilities available if you need to adjust the font colors
  after the background color change to ensure accessibility.
restrictions:
 - Footer is to be used only at the bottom of the page.
 - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("footer-1", "footer-2", "footer-1", etc).
