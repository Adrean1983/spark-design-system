{{#embed "patterns.components.notifications.base" type="failure" icon="exclaimation"}}{{#content "content"}}This is some text that a client needs to read because soemthing failed or went wrong. There is extra text in here to demonstrate the icon placement when the message goes longer than one line. You will notice that the icon to the left stays vertically centered, but the close icon remains in the top right corner. Notifications should never have this much text, though!{{/content}}{{/embed}}
