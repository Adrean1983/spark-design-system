  The Modal component is a dialog that is displayed on top of all site content. When a Modal is present,
  the rest of the site is inactive and covered by a mask overlay. Modals are by definition an interruption of
  the current user flow (they put the page into a new "mode"). Use a Modal when you need the user to enter a new
  flow before they continue their current task, or to provide additional contextual information about the current
  task. For example, you could use a modal to get confirmation from the user before deleting a record, or to
  display a critical error message before continuing the task at hand. Keep in mind that modals will always
  interrupt the current user task and should not be used if such an interruption is not desired. Research
  shows that mandatory interruptions are very detrimental to productivity.
information:
  - Spark Modals can be fully-controlled using a mouse, keyboard, and/or screen reader.
  - Modals can be closed by pressing the "Escape" key, clicking the Cancel button (in the Choice variant),
    clicking the Close icon (in the Choice or Info variants), or clicking the mask overlay (in the Choice or
    Info variants). Wait variant modals must be closed programatically.
  - The Modal and mask elements are hidden by default.
  - If the content in the Modal is too large for the viewport then the Modal will show a scroll bar.
  - When the Modal is opened, the first focusable element inside the Modal will receive focus.
  - While the Modal is open, focus is "trapped" inside the Modal. Pressing the Tab or Shift+Tab keys to move
    focus will only shift focus between the elements in the Modal.
  - When the Modal is closed, focus will be returned to the element that last had focus before the
    modal was opened.
restrictions:
  - The trigger element should always be outside the Modal container.
  - The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple
    instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance
    has a unique data-id property ("modal-choice-1", "modal-choice-2", "modal-info-1", etc).
