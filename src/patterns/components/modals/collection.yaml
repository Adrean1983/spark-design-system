  Examples of modals. Modals overtake the users screen forcing them to interact with it or to wait while the system performs an action in the background.
info:
  - Modals should be added to the DOM with Javascript.
  - Confirmation modals should be dismissible by tapping outside the modal, clicking cancel, and hitting the esc key.
