name: Validation Criteria, Partially Met
notes: |
  This is an example of inline validation on a field with validation criteria where some criteria are met.
info:
  - This is only used for fields that have uncommon criteria or restrictions. For example, password and username.
  - The criteria should start hidden and appear below the form field when the field is focused.
  - Once anything is entered into the field, the criteria should remain visible.
  - Refocusing into the field and meeting criteria will clear all red colors, fulfilled criteria will turn green, and x's will become check marks.
nono:
  - The x-mark is not to be used for regular error messages.
labels:
  - inprogress
order: 15
