  Spark has five spacing sizes to select from for creating new components or objects.
  The sizing options are xs, s, m, l, and xl. Using these sizes will help keep spacing consistent throughout the interface.
  The main forms of spacing are inset padding, inset with shorter vertical padding,
  inset with taller vertical padding, stacking, and aligning items inline. See each section below for a description, the variables to use,
  and examples. The green shows the padding and the the orange shows the margin.
