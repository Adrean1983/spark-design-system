# Contributing to Spark Design System

## Type of change

Contributions are divided into 2 types: **minor changes** and **substantial changes**.

### Minor Changes

Minor changes include, but are not limited to:

* Bug fixes
* Performance improvements
* Accessibility improvements
* Unit tests
* Spelling and grammar fixes

Minor changes should begin with an [issue on Github](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-design-system/issue) if you are unable to make the change yourself or are unsure if the change you want to make is needed. If you make the changes yourself, you can [open a pull request](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-design-system/pulls) for review.

If a minor change turns out to be substantial, the Spark team may ask you to go through the contribution workflow for substantial changes instead.

### Substantial Changes

Substantial changes generally fall into 2 categories: New components and amendments to an existing component that change its design or behavior. This type of change requires you to complete our contribution workflow to determine if a new component or change to an existing component aligns with the direction Spark is going.

#### Contribution Workflow

Coming soon.

Once you have determined that a new component or change is necessary, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-design-system/issues) using the "Contribution Proposal" issue template in Github to start the review process.

The Spark team will review your proposal and determine if it's a good fit. If it is, we will either add it to our backlog, or work with you on contributing the changes yourself.
