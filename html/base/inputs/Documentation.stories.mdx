# Input

- By default, Spark does not provide validation or formatting.  
- Special characters used in formatting (like the hyphens in the SSN field) are not automatically removed from the field value and may need to be manually removed. 
- Each input element's id should be unique on the page. 
- The 'type' attribute for an Input should be the most appropriate value that semantically matches your use case. 
- The data-id property is provided as a hook for automated tools. If you have multiple instances of the same variant of a component on the same page, make sure each instance has a unique data-id property ("input-text-1", "input-text-2", "input-date-1", etc). 
- In Vanilla JS applications, if an input is required only, meaning that no validation is needed aside from a value being supplied, you can add the `data-sprk-required-only` attribute to the input container. The values that are available are 'text', 'select', and 'tick'. Text is for any input that accepts text as a value, Select is only for select inputs, and Tick is for radio buttons or checkboxes.
- You should be providing your own validation for Inputs, not relying on the browser validation. Be sure to add the `novalidate` attribute to your form element to disable the browser implementation.
- The Input Label `for` attribute must match the `id` attribute of the corresponding Input.
- The value set in `aria-describedby` must match the `id` attribute on the error container.
