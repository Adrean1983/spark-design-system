# Spark Design System

Welcome to the Spark Design System, a product of [Quicken Loans](https://github.com/quickenloans).

Spark is used to build the user interfaces for Quicken Loans Fintech products.

## Monorepo

Spark is managed as a monorepo. All of the Spark source code lives in a single repo, but is released as separate packages using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

## Getting Started
More information on contributing to Spark will be available in the future. For now, if you want to get Spark running locally, follow these steps:
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `gulp --dev`
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Credit
Spark Design System uses [Drizzle](https://github.com/cloudfour/drizzle) as an authoring environment. Drizzle is an open source project from [Cloudfour](https://github.com/cloudfour) and is licensed under MIT.
